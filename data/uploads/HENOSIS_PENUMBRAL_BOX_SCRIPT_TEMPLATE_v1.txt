PENUMBRAL BOX SCRIPT TEMPLATE (HENOSIS) — v1
======================================================

PURPOSE
- Generate narrative scenes as ordered “BOXES” with consistent formatting for quick scripting + review.
- Keep occult layer literary: implied by image-objects, etiquette, metaphor, and subtext — not name-dropping.

HARD RULES (DO NOT BREAK)
- NO HTML / NO RICH TEXT / NO MARKDOWN TABLES.
- NO extra unicode icons except:
  - BOX markers: 🔷
  - Character color squares: 🟦 🟩 🟨 🟥 🟧 🟪 (use only what the project defines)
- Dialogue MUST be indented exactly as shown (4 spaces).
- Each BOX MUST include:
  1) BIG BOX HEADER (with diamonds + box number)
  2) TITLE LINE
  3) UNDERLINE made of "="
  4) DIALOGUE section (indented lines)
  5) ACTIONS section (indented bullet lines)

COLOR KEY (editable)
- 🟦 = STRIA
- 🟩 = ANTHEON
- 🟨 = KYMATA (telepathy)
(If more characters appear, assign a unique square and KEEP IT CONSISTENT.)

STYLE “MATERIALS” CHECKLIST (what every scene should carry)
1) Character Voice Integrity
   - Each character speaks from their archetypal function (no generic therapy voice).
   - If “occult,” it’s a felt metaphor: crooked crown, sealed book opening, threshold-light, etc.

2) Interiority Without Exposition
   - Emotional truth appears through: avoidance, timing, grip, misdirection, understatement.
   - Avoid over-explaining motive; let action + phrasing carry it.

3) Occult Layer: Literary, Not Glossary
   - Never dump proper nouns (“Malkuth,” etc.) unless explicitly requested.
   - Use objects and actions that imply correspondences:
     - “wrong crown,” “cliff etiquette,” “sealed book opens,” “hinge-light,” “the Work’s black kettle / first rinse,” etc.
   - One “anchor image-object” per BOX is ideal.

4) Resolution Logic
   - The scene must pivot: a misunderstanding is softened by a concrete kindness (gift/tool/gesture),
     and the guarded character is allowed one notch of openness (not total transformation).

FORMAT TEMPLATE (COPY/PASTE)
----------------------------

🔷🔷🔷 BOX {NN} 🔷🔷🔷
{TITLE}
====================

DIALOGUE
    {COLOR} {NAME}: (stage direction) {full line of dialogue}
    {COLOR} {NAME}: {full line of dialogue}
    {COLOR} {NAME}: {full line of dialogue}

ACTIONS
    - {action beat written plainly}
    - {action beat written plainly}
    - {action beat written plainly}

NOTES ON DIALOGUE LINES
- Keep each dialogue line as a complete sentence whenever possible.
- Avoid breaking one character’s thought into multiple lines unless it’s a deliberate rhythm choice.

MICRO-CONVENTIONS
- Telepathy is still dialogue:
    🟨 KYMATA: (telepathic, to X) {line}
- Parentheticals are short and actor-friendly:
    (deflated, ears down)
    (looks away, blushing)
    (softly)
- “ACTIONS” are for what the camera/reader can see.

EXAMPLE (REFERENCE SNIPPET — STRUCTURE ONLY)
--------------------------------------------

🔷🔷🔷 BOX 04 🔷🔷🔷
THE FINISH (BROTHERS UNDER SCORPIO)
===================================

DIALOGUE
    🟦 STRIA: (fist closes too quickly) Why are you acting like you already know me?
    🟩 ANTHEON: Because I recognize the weather.
    🟩 ANTHEON: You and I—and Kymata too—we’re Scorpio’s boys. Same deep water. Same scar-language.
    🟩 ANTHEON: So no: you’re not walking in on something you can’t belong to.
    🟩 ANTHEON: You’re walking into kin.

ACTIONS
    - Antheon collapses the triangle into family: “kin,” not rivalry.
    - Stria’s jealousy is re-labeled as loyalty seeking a home.
